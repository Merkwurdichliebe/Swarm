# Swarm
A 3D simulation of swarm behaviour with dynamic parameters.

- Population: number of elements in the swarm
- Interest: attraction to the light source
- Insecurity: tendency to stray away from the light source
- Spirit: tendency to change speed and motion vector

The arrow keys move the light source. Use SPACE to turn it on and off.
